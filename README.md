# Role Challenge - Software Engineering

This challenge is a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays a list of images from the development machine and allows the user to sort them by category. The project is built using the React Framework.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ayman-Shakil192/origin-health-challenge.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

## Login Page

The SPA contains a login page that allows for two types of users: normal and admin. Normal users have access to the dashboard page, while the admin can access both the admin dashboard page and the normal dashboard page.

## Dashboard Page

The SPA contains a dashboard page where the user can view all the images and sort them by category. The user can assign, reassign, or delete a label on an image. The user can also view images filtered by labels.

## Admin Dashboard Page

The Admin Dashboard page is where the admin can create new labels. These labels are used to categorize the images mentioned above on the main dashboard page.

## Building for production

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```bash
  npm run build
```

This will create a build directory with all the optimized files ready to be deployed.
