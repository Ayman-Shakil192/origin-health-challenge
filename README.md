# Role Challenge - Software Engineering

This challenge is a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays a list of images from the development machine and allows the user to sort them by category. The project is built using the React Framework.

## External Libraries used

The above challenge was completed with the help of

1. React Bootstrap
2. Semantic UI
3. MDB React UI kit
4. React Router
